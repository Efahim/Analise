# MOVING AVERAGE CONVERGENCE DIVERGENCE – MACD

## What is the "Moving Average Convergence Divergence - MACD"

Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the "signal line", is then plotted on top of the MACD, functioning as a trigger for buy and sell signals.

## BREAKING DOWN "Moving Average Convergence Divergence - MACD"

Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators can be interpreted using three different methods:

#### 1. Crossovers 
As shown in the chart above, when the MACD falls below the signal line, it is a bearish signal, which indicates that it may be time to sell. Conversely, when the MACD rises above the signal line, the indicator gives a bullish signal, which suggests that the price of the asset is likely to experience upward momentum. Many traders wait for a confirmed cross above the signal line before entering into a position to avoid getting getting "faked out" or entering into a position too early, as shown by the first arrow.
#### 2. Divergence 
When the security price diverges from the MACD, it signals the end of the current trend. For example, a stock price that is rising and a MACD indicator that is falling could mean that the rally is about to end. Conversely, if a stock price is falling and the MACD is rising, it could mean that a bullish reversal could occur in the near-term. Traders often use divergence in conjunction with other technical indicators to find opportunities.
#### 3. Dramatic Rise
When the MACD rises dramatically - that is, the shorter moving average pulls away from the longer-term moving average - it is a signal that the security is overbought and will soon return to normal levels. Traders will often combine this analysis with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or other technical indicators to verify overbought or oversold conditions.
Traders also watch for a move above or below the zero line because this signals the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. When the MACD is above zero, the short-term average is above the long-term average, which signals upward momentum. The opposite is true when the MACD is below zero. As you can see from the chart above, the zero line often acts as an area of support and resistance for the indicator.
### Trigger Line
A moving-average line found in the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) theory, which is used to signal buy or sell points for a security. The trigger line interacts with the two moving averages that form the MACD line and attempts to predict upcoming trends.
### BREAKING DOWN 'Trigger Line'
The trigger line provides traders with technical insight on when to long or short a stock. A common use of the trigger line is found in crossovers. When the trigger line crosses above the MACD line, a buy signal is sent, indicating that a trader should purchase the stock. Inversely, the trigger falling below the MACD represents a bearish trend, where the trader should short the stock.
### Signal Line
A moving average plotted alongside a technical indicator and is used to create transaction signals. Buy signals are generally created when the indicator crosses above the signal line, while sell signals are generated when the indicator crosses below it.

A signal line is also commonly known as a "trigger line."
### BREAKING DOWN 'Signal Line'
The MACD indicator and the stochastics oscillator are the two most popular tools used in technical analysis that generate transaction signals by using a signal line. Most trigger lines are created by using a three- to nine-period moving average of the indicator values.
### Confirmation
Confirmation refers to the use of an additional indicator or indicators to substantiate a trend suggested by one indicator. Since technical indicators are not perfect predictors of future price movements, a trader often feels more secure deciding to act on a signal if more than one indicator is sending the same signal. If different indicators send conflicting signals, this is known as divergence.
### BREAKING DOWN 'Confirmation'
Confirmation can also refer to a broker's written acknowledgment that they have completed a trade. These can be in electronic or paper form, and record information such as the date, price, commission, fees and settlement terms of the trade. Brokers typically send a confirmation within one week of the trade's completion.
Technical indicators fall into four broad categories: trend, momentum, volatility and volume. When seeking confirmation for a trade signal provided by one indicator, it is usually best to look to an indicator from a different category. Otherwise, the same or similar inputs are counted multiple times, giving the illusion of confirmation when in fact little new information has been taken into account. 
Trend indicators include moving averages, moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and the parabolic SAR. Momentum indicators include the stochastic oscillator, the commodity channel index (CCI) and the relative strength index (RSI). Volatility indicators include Bollinger Bands, standard deviation and average true range (ATR). Volume indicators include the Chaikin Oscillator (also used to measure momentum), on-balance volume (OBV) and the volume rate of change. (To learn more, see: How do Traders Identify Confirmation of Prices on a Chart?)
### Confirmation Example
Suppose a trader notices a golden cross, which occurs when the 50-day moving average, crosses above the 200-day moving average. This is a signal to buy the stock, based on a trend indicator (the moving averages). Because this signal alone does not guarantee higher prices, the trader might seek confirmation from a different type of indicator. In this case, a high trading volume would reinforce the buy signal, while lower volumes might make the trader reconsider taking a position in the stock. The OBV indicator would, therefore, be a logical choice to confirm the trade: a rising OBV would confirm the golden cross' bullish signal, while a flat or falling OBV would suggest that the price is nearing a top.

### Confirmation Bias
When seeking confirmation for a signal, investors should always be wary of confirmation bias, the tendency to set greater store by information that agrees with preconceived notions and to discard information that clashes with those notions. Of course, different sources of information always send conflicting messages to some extent, but traders should take care not to discount mixed signals.
### Indicator
Indicators are statistics used to measure current conditions as well as to forecast financial or economic trends. Economic indicators are statistical metrics used to measure the growth or contraction of the economy as a whole or sectors within the economy. Technical indicators are used extensively in technical analysis to predict changes in stock trends or price patterns in any traded asset. In fundamental analysis, economic indicators that quantify current economic and industry conditions are used to provide insight into the future profitability potential of public companies.
## BREAKING DOWN 'Indicator'
### Economic Indicators
There are many economic indicators created by different sources in both the private and the public sector. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is the research arm of the U.S. Department of Labor, compiles data on prices, employment and unemployment, compensation and work conditions and productivity. Within the price report is information on inflation, import and export prices and consumer spending.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) is a not-for-profit professional association for supply management and purchasing professionals. It has published its ISM Manufacturing Report on Business monthly since 1931. The report contains a composite index, the Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI), which contains information on manufacturing and non-manufacturing orders. The index is a closely watched barometer of economic activity. The U.S. Department of Commerce uses ISM data in its evaluation of the economy.
For most of the 21st century, housing a real estate have been leading economic indicators. There are several metrics used to measure housing growth including the S&P/Case-Shiller Index, which measures house sale prices, and the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, which is a survey of home builders that measures the market appetite for new homes.
Other economic indicators include interest rates, the money supply and consumer sentiment.
### Technical Indicators
In the context of technical analysis, an indicator is a mathematical calculation based on a security's price and/or volume. The result is used to predict future prices. Common technical analysis indicators are the moving average convergence-divergence (MACD) indicator and the relative strength index (RSI).
The MACD is based on the assumption that the tendency of the price of a traded asset is to revert to a trendline. In order to discover the trendline, traders look at the moving averages of asset prices over different time periods, often over 50 days, 100 days and 200 days. In addition, moving averages can be either simple or exponential.
The RSI compares the size of recent gains to recent losses to determine the asset's price momentum, either up or down. Using tools like the MACD and the RSI technical traders will analyze assets' price charts looking for patterns that will indicate when to buy or sell the asset under consideration.
## Percentage Price Oscillator – PPO
The percentage price oscillator (PPO) is a technical momentum indicator showing the relationship between two moving averages. To calculate the PPO, subtract the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the nine-day EMA, and then divide this difference by the 26-day EMA. The end result is a percentage that tells the trader where the short-term average is relative to the longer-term average.

Calculated as:
PPO = (9 Day EMA – 26 Day EMA) / 26 Day EMA

### BREAKING DOWN 'Percentage Price Oscillator - PPO'
The PPO and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) are both momentum indicators that measure the difference between the 26-day and the nine-day exponential moving averages. The main difference between these indicators is that the MACD reports the simple difference between the exponential moving averages, whereas the PPO expresses this difference as a percentage. This allows a trader to use the PPO indicator to compare stocks with different prices more easily. For example, regardless of the stock's price, a PPO result of 10 means the short-term average is 10% above the long-term average.
## Divergence
Divergence appears on a bar chart when the price of an asset and an indicator, index or other related asset move in opposite directions. In technical analysis, traders make transaction decisions by identifying situations of divergence, where the price of a stock and a set of relevant indicators, such as the money flow index (MFI), are moving in opposite directions.
### BREAKING DOWN 'Divergence'
![](https://github.com/Efahim/Analise/blob/master/Documents/Images/macd3.png)

In technical analysis, divergence is considered to be positive or negative. Either direction is a signal of a major shift in the direction of the price. Positive divergence occurs when the price of a security makes a new low while the indicator starts to climb. Negative divergence happens when the price of the security makes a new high, but the indicator fails to do the same and instead closes lower than the previous high.
### Interpreting Divergence

Divergence is usually associated with oscillator indicators. Oscillators measure the position of the current data for a specific factor (such as price, momentum or volume) relative to the total range of said factor for a specified number of historical bars on a bar chart. The calculation for oscillators takes various factors into account. A situation in which the calculation of an oscillator results in peaks that are trending lower, while the price action of the underlying security is exhibiting peaks that are making new highs with every price swing, indicates that each new high achieved by the underlying price is getting weaker in terms of the factor that is measured by the oscillator. On an appropriate price chart, a display of negative divergence will appear.
For example, the Chaikin oscillator, takes the trading volume of the underlying security into account. In a negative divergence situation (also referred to as bearish divergence), as price makes higher highs while the Chaikin indicator makes lower highs with each price swing, traders can conclude that the higher highs for price are being made with decreasing volume, signaling a potential reversal to the downside.
The inverse holds true for positive divergence. The relative strength index (RSI) takes into account the momentum of price action for the underlying security. In a positive divergence situation (also referred to as bullish divergence), as price makes lower lows while RSI makes higher lows with each price swing, traders can conclude that the lower lows for price are being made with less and less momentum, signaling a potential reversal to the upside.
### Misinterpreting Divergence

Trading signals derived from divergence that are based on oscillator indicators can be difficult to read, and they are sometimes misleading. When the market is in a strong trend in either direction, oscillators do not function well. Any signs of divergence during a strong trend would be ambiguous at best. Divergence is best suited for confirming market moves and should be used in conjunction with other technical indicators and fundamental analysis.
## Chaikin Oscillator
Named after its creator, Marc Chaikin, the Chaikin oscillator is an oscillator that measures the accumulation/distribution line of the moving average convergence divergence (MACD). The Chaikin oscillator is calculated by subtracting a 10-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the accumulation/distribution line from a three-day EMA of the accumulation/distribution line, and highlights the momentum implied by the accumulation/distribution line.
### BREAKING DOWN 'Chaikin Oscillator'

Fundamental analysts study business performance to glean information about the future direction of stock prices. Fundamental analysts believe that the ability to predict the market is about being the most informed. Technical analysts believe that all known information is already priced into the market and that patterns in the movement of stock prices can help to predict the future. Technical analysts use the Chaikin oscillator to find directional trends in momentum.
### Using the Chaikin Oscillator
To understand how the technical analyst uses the oscillator, imagine an auction. Accumulators or buyers are on one side, and distributors or sellers are on the other side. When there are more sellers in the room, the price of the item being sold goes down. Likewise, when there are more buyers in the room, the price of the item being sold tends to go up.
It is the balance of this relationship that drives markets. Analysts measure this relationship, the balance of buyers (accumulators), and sellers (distributors) with myriad indicators, including accumulation/distribution indicators such as the Chaikin oscillator.
### Chaikin Oscillator Usage Example
The goal of the Chaikin line is to identify levels of momentum within the accumulation/distribution line of the MACD indicator – specifically, it is the MACD applied to the accumulation/distribution line rather than prices.
For example, assume a trader wants to know if the price of a stock is going up or down. According to the chart, the MACD is trending up. The Chaikin oscillator shows a positive divergence with cross above the baseline. The baseline is referred to as the accumulation/distribution line. A cross above the baseline means traders are accumulating, which is a buy sign.
The Chaikin oscillator has two main signals. The first signal is a positive divergence, confirmed with a center-line crossover above the accumulation/distribution line, as is the case in the example. The second signal is a negative divergence confirmed with a center-line crossover below the accumulation/distribution line. The positive divergence is a sign the price is going up due to an increase in accumulation. The negative divergence is a sign the price is going down due to a decrease in accumulation.
Being able to recognize momentum in accumulation and distribution patterns gives technical traders an edge that they can use to develop a theory they can capitalize on. The strength of the oscillator provides signals to analysts about the direction of prices in the future.

## Histogram
1. A graphical representation, similar to a bar chart in structure, that organizes a group of data points into user-specified ranges. The histogram condenses a data series into an easily interpreted visual by taking many data points and grouping them into logical ranges or bins.

![](https://github.com/Efahim/Analise/blob/master/Documents/Images/macd4.png)

2. The MACD histogram is a very common technical indicator that illustrates the difference between the MACD line and the trigger line. This difference is then plotted on a chart in the form of a histogram to make it easy for a trader to determine a specific asset's momentum.
### BREAKING DOWN 'Histogram'
1.	Histograms are commonly used in statistics to demonstrate how many of a certain type of variable occurs within a specific range. For example, a census focused on the demography of a country may use a histogram of how many people there are between the ages of 0 and 10, 11 and 20, 21 and 30, 31 and 40, 41 and 50 etc. This histogram would look similar to the graph above.

2. MACD histograms are a popular tool used in technical analysis to gauge the strength of an asset's momentum. An increasing MACD histogram signals an increase in upward momentum while a decreasing histogram is used to signal downward momentum.
### Trade Signal
A trade signal is a trigger for action, either to buy or sell a security or other asset, generated by analysis. That analysis can be human generated using technical indicators. Or it can be generated using mathematical algorithms based on market action, possibly in combination with extra-market factors such as economic indicators.
### BREAKING DOWN 'Trade Signal'
Trade signals can use a variety of inputs from several disciplines. Typically, technical analysis is a major component but fundamental analysis, quantitative analysis and economics can also be inputs. They can include sentiment measures and even signals from other trade signal systems. The goal is to give investors and traders a mechanical method, devoid of emotion, to buy or sell a security or other asset.
Aside from simple buy and sell triggers, trade signals can be used to modify a portfolio by determining when it might be a good time to buy more of one particular sector, such as technology, and lighten up on another, such as consumer staples. Bond traders could have signals for adjusting the duration of their portfolios by selling one maturity and buying a different maturity.  And finally, it can also help with asset class allocation such as shifting money among stocks, bonds and gold.
There is no limit to how complex a trade signal can be. However, traders tend to keep things simple using only a handful of inputs. For practical purposes, it is far easier to manage a simple signal generator and periodically test it to see what components need adjusting or replacing. Too many inputs would introduce complexity requiring more time than a trader has to offer. And since markets change over time, often with great speed, complex strategies could be rendered obsolete before testing is even finished.
### Creating a Trade Signal
Again, there are endless possibilities but traders tend to just want to automate their thinking. An example might be, "for a stock with lower than a cetain price/earnings ratio, buy when a certain technical formation breaks out to the upside and prices are above a certain moving average and interest rates are falling."
Here are several of the more common inputs. Traders can combine them as they wish to meet whatever criterion they use to select trades.
Technical pattern breakout or break down. These can include triangles, rectangles, head-and-shoulders and trendlines.
Moving average cross. Most investors watch 50- and 200-day moving averages but there are many others in common use. The input could be when trading activity crosses above or below the average. Or, it could be when two averages cross each other.
Volume surge. Unusually high volume is often a precursor to a new move in the market. In the futures markets, open interest can also be used.
Interest rates. Changes in rates can often suggest changes in stock and commodity markets.
Volatility. There are many ways to measure volatility, and as with other indicators, extreme highs or lows in volatility can trigger market changes.
Cycles. Markets of all types tend to ebb and flow over time, even if they are in a steady trend or in a non-trending condition. One of the more widely known cycle is the seasonal cycle for stocks —sell in May and go away —which could help determine if a strategy is operating in the strong or weak half of the year.
Sentiment extremes. Used as a contrary indicator, excessive bullishness according to surveys or actual trading activity, can suggest market tops. Conversely, excessive bearishness can lead to market bottoms.
Valuation. Excessively high valuation compared to market, sector or stock specific measures can lead to sell signals.

# OTHER MACD RESOURCES

# A PRIMER ON THE MACD
_By Casey Murphy_

Learning to trade in the direction of short-term momentum can be a difficult task at the best of times, but it is exponentially more difficult when one is unaware of the appropriate tools that can help. This article will focus on the most popular indicator used in technical analysis, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD). Gerald Appel developed this indicator in the 1960s, and although its name sounds very complicated, it's really quite simple to use. Read on to learn how you can start looking for ways to incorporate this powerful tool into your trading strategy.
## Background Knowledge

The popularity of the MACD is largely due to its ability to help quickly spot increasing short-term momentum. However, before we jump into the inner workings of the MACD, it is important to completely understand the relationship between a short-term and long-term moving average.
As you can see from the chart below, many traders will watch for a short-term moving average (blue line) to cross above a longer-term moving average (red line) and use this to signal increasing upward momentum. This bullish crossover suggests that the price has recently been rising at a faster rate than it has in the past, so it is a common technical buy sign. Conversely, a short-term moving average crossing below a longer-term average is used to illustrate that the asset's price has been moving downward at a faster rate, and that it may be a good time to sell.
![](https://github.com/Efahim/Analise/blob/master/Documents/Images/macd5.png)

_Figure 1_

## The Indicator

Notice how the moving averages diverge away from each other in Figure 1 as the strength of the momentum increases. The MACD was designed to profit from this divergence by analyzing the difference between the two exponential moving averages. Specifically, the value for the long-term moving average is subtracted from the short-term average, and the result is plotted onto a chart. The periods used to calculate the MACD can be easily customized to fit any strategy, but traders will commonly rely on the default settings of 12- and 26-day periods.
A positive MACD value, created when the short-term average is above the longer-term average, is used to signal increasing upward momentum. This value can also be used to suggest that traders may want to refrain from taking short positions until a signal suggests it is appropriate. On the other hand, falling negative MACD values suggest that the downtrend is getting stronger, and that it may not be the best time to buy.
## Transaction Signals

It has become standard to plot a separate moving average alongside the MACD, which is used to create a clear signal of shifting momentum. A signal line, also known as the trigger line, is created by taking a nine-period moving average of the MACD. This is found plotted alongside the indicator on the chart. As you can see in Figure 2, transaction signals are generated when the MACD line (the solid line) crosses through the signal line (nine-period exponential moving average (EMA) - dotted blue line).
The basic bullish signal (buy sign) occurs when the MACD line (the solid line) crosses above the signal line (the dotted line), and the basic bearish signal (sell sign) is generated when the MACD crosses below the signal line. Traders who attempt to profit from bullish MACD crosses that occur when the indicator is below zero should be aware that they are attempting to profit from a change in momentum direction, while the moving averages are still suggesting that the security could experience a short-term sell-off. This bullish crossover can often correctly predict the reversal in the trend as shown in Figure 2, but it is often considered riskier than if the MACD were above zero.
![](https://github.com/Efahim/Analise/blob/master/Documents/Images/macd6.png)

_Figure 2_

Another common signal that many traders watch for occurs when the indicator travels in the opposite direction of the asset, known as divergence. This concept takes further study and is often used by experienced traders.
## The Centerline

As mentioned earlier, the MACD indicator is calculated by taking the difference between a short-term moving average (12-day EMA) and a longer-term moving average (26-day EMA). Given this construction, the value of the MACD indicator must be equal to zero each time the two moving averages cross over each other. As you can see in Figure 3, a cross through the zero line is a very simple method that can be used to identify the direction of the trend and the key points when momentum is building.

![](https://github.com/Efahim/Analise/blob/master/Documents/Images/macd7.png)

_Figure 3_

## Advantages

In the previous examples, the various signals generated by this indicator are easily interpreted and can be quickly incorporated into any short-term trading strategy. At the most basic level, the MACD indicator is a very useful tool that can help traders ensure that short-term direction is working in their favor.
## Drawbacks

The biggest disadvantage of using this indicator to generate transaction signals is that a trader can get whipsawed in and out of a position several times before being able to capture a strong change in momentum. As you can see in the chart, the lagging aspect of this indicator can generate several transaction signals during a prolonged move, and this may cause the trader to realize several unimpressive gains or even small losses during the rally.

![](https://github.com/Efahim/Analise/blob/master/Documents/Images/macd8.png)

_Figure 4_

Traders should be aware that the whipsaw effect can be severe in both trending and range-bound markets, because relatively small movements can cause the indicator to change directions quickly. The large number of false signals can result in a trader taking many losses. When commissions are factored into the equation, this strategy can become very expensive.
Another MACD drawback is its inability to make comparisons between different securities. Because the MACD is the dollar value between the two moving averages, the reading for differently priced stocks provides little insight when comparing a number of assets to each other. In an attempt to fix this problem, many technical analysts will use the percentage price oscillator, which is calculated in a similar fashion as the MACD, but analyzes the percentage difference between the moving averages rather than the dollar amount.
## Conclusion

The MACD indicator is the most popular tool in technical analysis, because it gives traders the ability to quickly and easily identify the short-term trend direction. The clear transaction signals help minimize the subjectivity involved in trading, and the crosses over the signal line make it easy for traders to ensure that they are trading in the direction of momentum. Very few indicators in technical analysis have proved to be more reliable than the MACD, and this relatively simple indicator can quickly be incorporated into any short-term trading strategy.

# SPOTTING TREND REVERSALS WITH MACD
 _By Ryan Campbell_
 
If there were ever a quest in the world of investing on par with the search for the Holy Grail, it would be acquiring the ability to spot trend changes. There are many ways investors attempt to do this with varying degrees of success, but a common trend-tracking tool is the two-line moving average convergence divergence (MACD). This tool measures a stock's momentum and can aid investors in spotting changes in market sentiment.
Just like stock prices, momentum will trend. Momentum changes precede stock price changes. This article is designed to help you spot trend changes in momentum and stock price.
## Nature of Momentum
Momentum in charting is similar to momentum in physics; if you throw a ball in the air, it will ascend at a slower and slower pace the higher it projects. After monitoring the changing momentum, a person can determine when the ball will stop climbing, change direction and descend.
Just like in physics, momentum changes occur before the price of a stock changes. These momentum changes can be easily observed using the MACD (mack-dee) indicator. (Buy high and sell higher. Find out if you could surf these risky waters, see Riding The Momentum Investing Wave.)

## Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
Gerald Appel developed the MACD indicator in an attempt to chart momentum by measuring the increasing and decreasing space between two exponential moving averages (usually the 12-day and the 26-day). If the distance between the two moving averages is diverging, then momentum is increasing, whereas if the moving averages are converging, then momentum is decreasing. The distance between the two moving averages is graphed in what is called a MACD line (black), as seen in Figure 1.

![](https://github.com/Efahim/Analise/blob/master/Documents/Images/macd9.png)

_Figure 1: Two-line MACD_

To confirm changes in momentum, a nine-day exponential moving average is added as a signal line (the red line in Figure 1). A buy signal occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. The sell signal occurs when the MACD line falls below the signal line. In an attempt to optimize these signals, it was found that 12- and 26-day moving averages for long-term signals and seven and 18-day moving averages for short-term signals were ideal. (For background on this technical indicator, check out A Primer On The MACD.)
## Channeling the MACD
The practice of drawing trendlines on a stock chart is as almost as old as buying stock itself, but what you may not know is that you can also draw trendlines on the indicators, such as the two-line MACD. Drawing a support and a resistance level at the same time creates a channel of action that helps measure the trend's current strength.
In Figure 2, we measured the stock's trend strength by creating a channel. To create the channel, draw support by connecting the bottoms and determine the return line by connecting the tops of the MACD.
In November 2008 and then in February 2009, the MACD created lower highs while the stock price created equal highs; this is called divergence and tells investors that the stock is losing momentum. Investors could choose short positions when the MACD line bounces down off resistance. The short position may be covered when the MACD line reaches support at the channel's bottom or for long-term trades when the channel is broken, like it was near the end of April 2009. (For related reading, see Divergences, Momentum And Rate Of Change.)

_Figure 2: Bearish divergence and trend_

_Source: ProphetCharts_

If we had looked at Figure 3 in July 2008, we may have noticed that the MACD was making higher lows and diverging from the stock price. This phenomenon is signaling a possible reversal. In November, the reversal was confirmed when the MACD created a major higher low, demonstrating a buildup in bullish momentum.
January 2009 saw the stock make a brand-new high when it broke long-term resistance; however, the MACD showed that momentum wasn't confirming the breakout. The MACD kept falling as the stock attempted to establish support near the $80 level. When the stock broke support, the MACD broke its support line, confirming that the stock would not maintain its current price level and investors should sell their shares.

## The Bottom Line
The strength of the current trend can be measured by channeling the MACD. Spot trend reversals by looking for divergences in momentum as measured by the MACD channel. Determine buy and sell signals using the MACD crossovers or bounces off the channel's lines. Learning to implement and recognize these signals helps investors increase their profits when trading short and intermediate-term trends.
