# CONFIRMATION

Confirmation refers to the use of an additional indicator or indicators to substantiate a trend suggested by one indicator. 
Since technical indicators are not perfect predictors of future price movements, a trader often feels more secure deciding to 
act on a signal if more than one indicator is sending the same signal. If different indicators send conflicting signals, this is 
known as divergence.

## BREAKING DOWN "Confirmation"

Confirmation can also refer to a broker's written acknowledgment that they have completed a trade. These can be in electronic or 
paper form, and record information such as the date, price, commission, fees and settlement terms of the trade. Brokers typically 
send a confirmation within one week of the trade's completion.

Technical indicators fall into four broad categories: trend, momentum, volatility and volume. When seeking confirmation for a 
trade signal provided by one indicator, it is usually best to look to an indicator from a different category. Otherwise, the same 
or similar inputs are counted multiple times, giving the illusion of confirmation when in fact little new information has been 
taken into account. 

Trend indicators include moving averages, moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and the parabolic SAR. Momentum indicators 
include the stochastic oscillator, the commodity channel index (CCI) and the relative strength index (RSI). Volatility indicators 
include Bollinger Bands, standard deviation and average true range (ATR). Volume indicators include the Chaikin Oscillator (also 
used to measure momentum), on-balance volume (OBV) and the volume rate of change. (To learn more, see: How do Traders Identify 
Confirmation of Prices on a Chart?)

## Confirmation Example

Suppose a trader notices a golden cross, which occurs when the 50-day moving average, crosses above the 200-day moving average. 
This is a signal to buy the stock, based on a trend indicator (the moving averages). Because this signal alone does not guarantee 
higher prices, the trader might seek confirmation from a different type of indicator. In this case, a high trading volume would 
reinforce the buy signal, while lower volumes might make the trader reconsider taking a position in the stock. The OBV indicator 
would, therefore, be a logical choice to confirm the trade: a rising OBV would confirm the golden cross' bullish signal, while a 
flat or falling OBV would suggest that the price is nearing a top.

## Confirmation Bias

When seeking confirmation for a signal, investors should always be wary of confirmation bias, the tendency to set greater 
store by information that agrees with preconceived notions and to discard information that clashes with those notions. Of 
course, different sources of information always send conflicting messages to some extent, but traders should take care not to 
discount mixed signals.
